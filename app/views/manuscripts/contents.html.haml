                    Change a section's name by erasing its current name and typing the new name.
                %li
                    Change the order of sections by dragging and dropping them into the positions you want.
                %li
                    Delete a section by selecting "Delete", but be careful; we keep no backups at this time, so it will be an IRREVERSIBLE action.
